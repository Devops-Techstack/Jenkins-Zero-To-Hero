Deploy Minikube and jenkins in same docker network .Both will be deployed in Docker container.
Pre-requisite: Install Docker Desktop and Minikube on your local .
docker network ls 
minikube start - By default it will be created in minikube network .
docker run -d --name jenkins -p 8080:8080  -v jenkins_data2:/var/jenkins_home --network minikube jenkins/jenkins:lts

Go to http://localhost:8080/ , Create a new user , get the admin password , install plugins
docker logs container-id : Get Admin password 

Need  to integrate Jenkins and Minikube:
Get Kubeconfig of minikube cluster: cat  ~/.kube/config
Replace certificate-authority,client-certificate and client-key with certificate-authority-data,client-certificate-data and client-key-data
Also by default it will be file path , replace them with actual content in base 64 encoded format.
Also replace     server: https://192.168.49.2:8443 , The ip will be output of minikube ip command.

Install the kubernetes plugin from the Available plugin section .

Now create a credential in jenkins to store kubeconfig
http://localhost:8080/manage/credentials/store/system/domain/_/
Add credential -> Type Secret File -> Upload the config file -> Give Id as test-minikube


Create the Pipeline project now .
